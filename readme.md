# Twitch Chrome Extension
I wanted to be able to quickly check the top streams on twitch, without having to load the website, search by streams, then be able to see which interesting streams are on right now...

So I created that little extension that allows me to quickly check the 50 most popular streams on Twitch at that moment, just after 1 single click :)
